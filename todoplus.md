# Helper AI Lightweight Migration - Remaining Tasks

Based on comprehensive analysis of migration documentation, this document identifies remaining critical tasks to complete the Supabase to PostgreSQL/Drizzle ORM migration and optimize the lightweight architecture.

## CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES (MUST BE COMPLETED FIRST)

### Task 1: Resolve Compilation Dependencies
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Subagent:** backend-architect  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Status:** From Integration Testing Report - Critical dependencies missing preventing compilation

**Claude Code Prompt:**
```
I need to resolve critical compilation failures in the Helper AI application that prevent it from starting. Based on the integration testing report, there are missing dependencies and incomplete migrations.

Please fix these blocking issues:

1. **Missing Supabase Dependencies**: Remove or replace all remaining Supabase imports
   - Search for any remaining @supabase/ssr or @supabase/supabase-js imports
   - Remove or replace /lib/supabase/ directory files if they still exist
   - Update any components still trying to import from Supabase packages

2. **Missing Internal Package**: Resolve @helperai/client dependency
   - Check /Users/dmzmzmd/helper/jobs/trigger.ts and other files importing @helperai/client
   - Either install this package or replace with direct implementations
   - Fix job trigger system functionality

3. **tRPC Dependencies**: Complete removal of @trpc/server dependencies
   - Find and remove remaining tRPC imports in /lib/ai/chat.ts
   - Replace TRPCError with custom error handling
   - Update /jobs/trigger.ts to use direct API calls instead of tRPC patterns

4. **Package.json Cleanup**: 
   - Remove @supabase/* packages from dependencies
   - Remove @trpc/* packages if not needed
   - Ensure all required packages for JWT auth and SWR are installed

Focus on getting the application to compile and start successfully. The goal is to resolve the "Module resolution errors for Supabase and tRPC packages" identified in testing.

Key files to examine:
- /Users/dmzmzmd/helper/lib/ai/chat.ts
- /Users/dmzmzmd/helper/jobs/trigger.ts  
- /Users/dmzmzmd/helper/package.json
- Any files in /lib/supabase/ directory
```

### Task 2: Complete Schema Reference Migration
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Subagent:** database-expert  
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

**Status:** Partially complete - issueGroups reference was fixed but may have other inconsistencies

**Claude Code Prompt:**
```
The database schema has been migrated to use the new naming convention (tableNameTable), but there may be remaining inconsistencies throughout the codebase where old table names are still referenced.

Please complete the schema reference migration:

1. **Search for Old Table References**: Find any remaining references to old table names
   - Search for patterns like: conversations, users, messages, issueGroups, etc.
   - Look for imports that don't follow the tableNameTable convention
   - Check all database queries and joins

2. **Update All References**: Ensure consistent use of new table names
   - conversationsTable, usersTable, conversationMessagesTable, etc.
   - Update all import statements from @/db/schema
   - Fix any relation references to use TableRelations naming

3. **Verify TypeScript Compilation**: 
   - Ensure all schema references are correct
   - Test that database operations compile without errors
   - Check that all foreign key relationships work

4. **Test Database Operations**:
   - Verify basic CRUD operations work with the new schema
   - Test that relationships between tables function correctly
   - Ensure no missing table or column references

The schema naming convention should follow:
- Table exports: entityTable (e.g., conversationsTable)
- Relations exports: entityTableRelations (e.g., conversationsTableRelations)

Files to focus on:
- /Users/dmzmzmd/helper/db/schema.ts and schema files
- All API routes that do database operations
- Components that import from @/db/schema
- tRPC routers and procedures
```

### Task 3: Fix Database Migration Script
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Subagent:** database-expert  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Status:** Cannot complete due to missing PostgreSQL extensions (pgmq, pg_cron, http)

**Claude Code Prompt:**
```
The database migration script cannot complete because it requires PostgreSQL extensions that may not be available in all environments. I need to create alternative lightweight implementations.

Please fix the migration issues:

1. **Remove Extension Dependencies**: 
   - Replace pgmq (PostgreSQL Message Queue) with simple job table implementation
   - Replace pg_cron (PostgreSQL Cron) with application-level scheduling using setTimeout
   - Replace http extension with application-level HTTP requests

2. **Update Migration Scripts**:
   - Modify migration files in /Users/dmzmzmd/helper/db/migrations/ 
   - Ensure migration works with standard PostgreSQL 14+ without special extensions
   - Test that `pnpm db:migrate` completes successfully

3. **Lightweight Job System**: 
   - Use the existing simple job system instead of pgmq
   - Implement job scheduling with database table + setTimeout
   - Ensure job processing works without external queue systems

4. **Database Client Updates**:
   - Update /Users/dmzmzmd/helper/db/client.ts if needed
   - Remove any extension-dependent configurations
   - Ensure connection pooling works correctly

5. **Test Migration**:
   - Test complete migration on fresh PostgreSQL database
   - Verify all tables and relationships are created correctly
   - Ensure data integrity is maintained

The goal is a migration script that works with any standard PostgreSQL installation without requiring special extensions or elevated permissions.

Files to examine:
- /Users/dmzmzmd/helper/db/migrations/
- /Users/dmzmzmd/helper/db/client.ts
- Any job-related schema or setup files
```
