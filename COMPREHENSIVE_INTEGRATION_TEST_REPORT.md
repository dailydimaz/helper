## Technical Issues Found and Recommendations

### üî¥ Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

1. **Import Reference Errors**
   - **Issue:** Some files still reference old Supabase schema exports
   - **Impact:** Prevents health endpoints from compiling
   - **Fix:** Update all `aiUsageEvents` imports to `aiUsageEventsTable`
   - **Files Affected:** `/lib/data/aiUsageEvents.ts`, `/lib/ai/index.ts`

2. **Edge Runtime Warnings**
   - **Issue:** Node.js modules used in Edge Runtime contexts
   - **Impact:** Deployment warnings and potential runtime issues
   - **Fix:** Configure Next.js runtime settings or refactor modules

### üü° Minor Issues (Recommended Fixes)

1. **Authentication Middleware Refinement**
   - **Issue:** Some edge cases in protected route handling
   - **Fix:** Review middleware logic for comprehensive protection
   - **Impact:** Low - core functionality works

2. **404 Error Handling Consistency**
   - **Issue:** Inconsistent error response formatting
   - **Fix:** Standardize error response format across all endpoints
   - **Impact:** Low - affects error handling only

3. **Cron Pattern Support**
   - **Issue:** Complex cron patterns not fully supported
   - **Fix:** Enhanced cron parser or documentation of limitations
   - **Impact:** Low - basic scheduling works
