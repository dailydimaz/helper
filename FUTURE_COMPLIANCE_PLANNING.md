❌ Avoid:
- "Helper Pro Features"
- "Official Helper Extensions"

```

### API Development Guidelines

#### Endpoint Naming:
```javascript
// Compliant API endpoints
/api/community/chat
/api/community/analytics
/api/extensions/workflow

// Avoid these patterns
/api/helper-pro/           // ❌ Suggests official extension
/api/gumroad/             // ❌ Uses Gumroad name
/api/official/            // ❌ Implies endorsement
```

#### API Documentation Standards:
- Always include Helper™ compatibility information
- Specify community-developed nature
- Include proper trademark attribution
- Disclaim official endorsement

### Integration Development

#### Third-Party Service Integrations:
```typescript
// Service integration example
interface IntegrationConfig {
    serviceName: string;
    description: string;
    helperCompatibility: string;
    trademarkNotice: string;
}

const slackIntegration: IntegrationConfig = {
    serviceName: "Slack Community Connector",
    description: "Community-developed Slack integration for Helper™",
    helperCompatibility: "Helper™ v2.1+",
