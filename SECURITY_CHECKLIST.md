## ‚úÖ Deployment Verification

### Security Headers Test

```bash
# Test main application
curl -I https://your-domain.com/

# Expected headers:
# X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
# X-Frame-Options: DENY
# X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

- [ ] All security headers present
- [ ] HSTS header includes correct max-age
- [ ] No sensitive information in headers

### Rate Limiting Verification

```bash
# Test login rate limiting
for i in {1..6}; do 
  curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"wrong"}'
done

# Expected: 429 status after 5 attempts
```

- [ ] Rate limiting blocks after configured attempts
- [ ] Proper 429 status code returned
- [ ] Retry-After header included

### Authentication Security

```bash
# Test protected endpoints without auth
curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/adm/users

# Expected: 401 status
```

- [ ] Protected endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Proper 401 status for unauthenticated requests
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed without auth

### CORS Verification

```bash
# Test CORS with unauthorized origin
curl -H "Origin: https://malicious-site.com" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
