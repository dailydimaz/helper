# Remove Docker Dependencies - Lightweight Migration Todo

## Overview
Request to remove all Docker-related components and dependencies from the HelperAI lightweight PostgreSQL system. This aligns with the lightweight architecture philosophy of minimal dependencies and direct system integration.

## Current Docker Usage Analysis
- Nginx proxy container for local development
- Docker network configuration (supabase_network_helper)
- Docker-related scripts and configurations
- Package.json scripts with Docker commands

## Goal
Complete removal of Docker dependencies while maintaining all functionality through native system alternatives.
